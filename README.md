<h1 align="center">Common Sorting Algorithms</h1>

This repository offers an overview of different common sorting algorithms implemented in various programming languages. Understanding sorting algorithms is crucial for any programmer, as they are widely used in various applications to efficiently organize data. Whether you're a beginner learning algorithms or an experienced developer seeking implementation examples, this repository aims to serve as a valuable resource for understanding and comparing different sorting techniques.

<h3> The sorting algorithms covered in this repository include: </h3>

- **Selection Sort (Tri par s√©lection)**: Divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the sorting order) element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.

- **Insertion Sort (Tri par insertion)**: Builds a sorted list by repeatedly taking one element at a time from the unsorted list and inserting it at its correct position in the sorted list.

- **Bubble Sort (Tri √† bulles)**: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are not in the correct order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

- **Merge Sort (Tri fusion)**: Divides the input list into smaller sublists, sorts these sublists recursively, and then merges them in the correct order.

- **Quick Sort (Tri rapide)**: Selects a pivot element from the list, partitions the list into two sublists such that all elements lower than the pivot come before it and all elements higher than the pivot come after it. It then recursively sorts the sublists.

- **Heap Sort (Tri par tas)**: Builds a heap structure from the input list and repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap, reconstructing the heap until the list is sorted.
